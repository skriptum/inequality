Research Question: **Cementing the Divide? Housing and Wealth Inequality across Europe**



## Relevance of Topic

- Piketty 2014 - wealth inequality back in debate
- Missing affordability of housing (especially for first buyers)
- rising prices across Europe after financial crisis



who profits from the gains of price increase?

- shifts in the last 10 years
- Composition of Housing Asset = relevant for the inequality effect
- countries with broad ownership = react differently than with a lot of tenants



## Approach

- start with Case Example Germany
  - biggest european economy
  - renter country
  - sharp increase in housing price in last 10 years
  - analyze the reaction of (housing) wealth inequality to price increases, possible methods:
    - Local Projections 
    - Gini Decomposition

- move on to European analysis
  - different distributions of housing wealth among countries
  - different price trajectories among countries
    - Spain = flatline
    - Germany = strong increase

  - build a panel regression to estimate differential effects
    - control with macro data etc.

  - = show that a uniform price increase = different effects among countries

- Data
  - Distributional Wealth Accounts from the ECB @engelDevelopingReconciledQuarterly2022
  - detailed asset compositions of deciles in all european countries 
  - quarterly 2011-2024 (post GFC to covid dip)
  - other: range of macro data from Eurostat (home ownership rates, housing prices)



## Literature

wealth inequality = more relevant topic in the last years

- piketty 2014, WID.world
- @albersDistributionWealthGermany2020 for germany



housing as driver in Europe:

- @biewenShapeWealthDistribution2025: general description of wealth inequality among european countries
- @mathaHouseholdWealthEuro2017: analyses the role of housing wealth and intergenerational transfers

case examples:

- Spain: @martinez-toledanoHousePriceCycles housing prices and inequality
- Germany: @bartelsBedeutungMieteinkommenUnd2020 focusing on role of rental income and subregional analysis in germany



## Expected Results

countries with rising prices and high ownership, e.g. Netherlands = no contributing effect of housing inequality

countries with rising prices and low ownership, e.g. Germany = contributing effect

countries with stagnating prices and high ownership = no contributing effect of housing, but other assets have stronger effect

differences depending on policy variations, migration, lags, ...
