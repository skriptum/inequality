  abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the long-run evolution of wealth inequality in Germany. We combine tax data, surveys, national accounts and rich lists to study the distribution of wealth in Germany from 1895 to 2018. We show that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1\% has fallen by half,from close to 50\% in 1895 to less than 25\% today.The interwar period as well as World War II and its aftermath stand out as the great equalizers in 20th century German history.Since unification, two off-setting trends have shaped the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising equity valuations that were counterbalanced by large middle-class capital gains from rising house prices. Since 1993, wealth of the top 10\% and of the middle class(50-90\%) approximately doubled in real terms. However, these asset price induced gains in business and housing wealth almost entirely by-passed households in the bottom half of the wealt distribution who do not own these assets. Wealth of the bottom 50\% of the population has stagnated since 1993 and their share in total wealth has nearly halved. The wealth gap between households in the bottom and the upper half has widened significantly. In 1993, households in the top 10\% were about 50 times richer than households in the bottom half. Today, they are 100 times richer. Finally,we also show that official statistics underestimate privately held German business wealth and real estate wealth.},

According to Insee's Housing surveys, 32\% of young low-income households were homeowners in 1973, as compared to only 16\% in 2013. Beyond the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors (real estate prices, interest rates, term of loans granted, etc.), a decomposition of changes in ownership rates over the period using the ``Oaxaca-Blinder'' method highlights the role of changes in family structures (increasing proportion of single-parent families, decline in the share of couples with children in the most modest households) and the sharp decline in small rural home ownership. Family support -- gift assistance, inheritance and other forms of aid -- also played an important part in the 2000s: four out of ten recent homeowners benefited from it, two out of ten even receiving direct financial assistance for their purchase. This support increased significantly among wealthier households during the 2000s, contributing to a widening gap with the share of homeowners in the least well-off populations.},

In the change decomposition, methods are presented to break down the contribution of each explanatory factor into a coefficients effect, a correlation effect, and a standard deviation effect. In an application to rising earnings inequality in the United States, it is found that schooling is the single most explanatory variable, only one other variable (occupation) has any appreciable role to play, and all of schooling's effect was a coefficients effect.},

  abstract = {Measuring and understanding the evolution of wealth inequality is a key challenge for researchers, policy makers, and the general public. This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970--2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1\% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one's labor income only.},

This finding is robust to the use of both the Gini coefficient and top income share as measures of income inequality and the use of absolute and relative income inequality measures, as well as a range of other robustness checks.

We show that this negative relationship is robust to controlling for other observables using a counterfactual decomposition of cross-country inequality differences based on a recentered influence function regression. Furthermore, by decomposing the Gini coefficient across owners and renters we argue that the negative relationship is mostly driven by large inequality between the two groups. We also find that the cross-country differences in the homeownership rate and its negative correlation with wealth inequality are to a large extent driven by households in the lower half of the wealth distribution. Thus, not only the top percentiles but also the lower tail is important in accounting for overall wealth inequality. JEL Codes: D31, E21, G11.},

To address this inherent design flaw, we propose to determine the predictor weights and donor weights separately. We show how the donor weights can be optimized when the predictor weights are given, and consider alternative data-driven approaches to determine the predictor weights. Re-examination of the two original empirical applications to Basque terrorism and California's tobacco control program demonstrates the complete and utter failure of the existing SCM algorithms and illustrates our proposed remedies.},

  abstract = {How individual income sources affect income inequality has long been important for interpreting economic trends and for making public policy. Whether the issue is changes in budget and tax policies, in social security benefits, or in the treatment of a form of property income, a major part of the debate is over the distributional impact of the policies that raise or lower particular income sources. Our understanding of economic inequality partly turns on our estimates of the impacts of the rising share of women in the paid labor force, of the increasing returns to human capital, and of the changing distribution and levels of net worth. Until the late 1970s, the problem for the analyst appeared straightforward. To estimate how a tax or transfer program affected inequality, one could simply calculate an inequality index both before the tax or transfer (say IB) and after the tax or transfer (IA) and then tabulate the percentage change in I. Studies of the US tax and transfer system typically utilize this approach (see, for examples, Smolensky and Reynolds, 1977; Pechmanand Okner 1974; Danziger, 1977; and, more recently, Barthold, Nunns and Toder, 1995). Researchers recognize that these before-after tabulations rarely took account of behavioral impacts induced by the tax or transfer, but viewed the problem of determining the changes in each individual's net income as analytically distinct from the problem of calculating the inequality impact of the combination of individual income changes.},

We show that each source's contribution to the Gini coefficient may be viewed as the product of the source's own Gini, its share of total income, and its correlation with the rank of total income. Applying the approach to the 1980 U.S. distribution of income yields several interesting results, including the finding that spouse's earnings had a larger marginal impact on inequality than did property income.},

  abstract = {In common sociological research, income inequality is measured only at the aggregate level. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate that there is more than meets the eye when inequality is indicated by a single measure. In this article, I introduce an alternative method that evaluates individuals' contributions to inequality as well as the between-group and within-group components of these individual contributions. I first highlight three common inequality measures, the Gini index and two generalized entropy measures---Theil's T and Theil's L indices---by presenting their individual components as a method for evaluating inequality. Five artificial data examples illustrate the use of these individual components first. An empirical analysis of the 2007 and 2017 Current Population Survey data then focuses on the differences in inequality revealed by such individual inequality components between the 2007 and 2017. The individual-level inequality measures can reveal patterns of inequality concealed by single measures at the aggregate level. In particular, the Gini individual measures differentiate cases better than the generalized entropy measures and tend to have smaller standard errors in a regression analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the determinants of wealth inequality dynamics during housing booms and busts. I examine two episodes over the last four decades in Spain by combining fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts to reconstruct the entire wealth distribution. I then develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation that makes it possible to disentangle the importance of differences in rates of return, savings, labor incomes and portfolio choices across wealth groups in explaining wealth inequality dynamics. My analysis documents that top wealth holders time better the market, saving a larger share on housing during booms and reshuffling their portfolio away from housing towards financial assets at the beginning of busts. Counterfactual simulations show that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is the only channel that contributed to reducing the bottom 50\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. Finally, I document that this heterogeneity in portfolio choices is consistent with the existence of large differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups, mainly coming through differences in the composition of housing. Taken together, these results reveal that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is an important driver of short to medium term fluctuations of wealth inequality.},

  abstract = {This paper uses survey data from Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain and the United States to analyze how inheritances impact wealth inequality in a range of rich countries. Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures---confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality---an increase in recipients of `large' inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what `large' means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. We find that transfers above the ninety-fifth percentile of the national transfer distribution are generally associated with an increasing effect on wealth inequality. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.},

  abstract = {Comparative research on income inequality has produced several frameworks to study the institutional determinants of income stratification. In contrast, no such framework and much less empirical evidence exist to explain cross-national differences in wealth inequality. This situation is particularly lamentable as cross-national patterns of inequality in wealth diverge sharply from those in income. We seek to pave the way for new explanations of cross-national differences in wealth inequality by tracing them to the influence of different wealth components. Drawing on the literatures on financialization and housing, we argue that housing equity should be the central building block of the comparative analysis of wealth inequality. Using harmonized data on 15 countries included in the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS), we demonstrate a lack of association between national levels of income and wealth inequality and concentration. Using decomposition approaches, we then estimate the degree to which national levels of wealth inequality and concentration relate to cross-national differences in wealth portfolios and the distribution of specific asset components. Considering the role of housing equity, financial assets, non-housing real assets, and non-housing debt, we show that cross-national variation in wealth inequality and concentration is centrally determined by the distribution of housing equity.},

Whereas the largest wage gaps were once concentrated among lower-paid, lower-educated workers, today these wage gaps sit among the highest-paid, highly-educated workers. Given this reordering of gender wage inequality and the centrality of college graduates to total inequality trends, in this article, we assess the contribution of higher education mechanisms to top-end gender inequality. Specifically, we use Census and ACS data along with unique decomposition models to assess the extent to which two mechanisms rooted in higher education-bachelor's-level fields of study and the attainment of advanced degrees-can account for the gender wage gap across the wage distribution. Results from these decomposition models show that while these explanatory mechanisms fare well among bottom and middle wages, their explanatory power breaks down among the highest-paid college workers. We conclude that women's attainment of "different" education (via fields of study) or "more" education (via advanced degrees) would do little to close the gender wage gaps that are contributing most to contemporary wage inequality trends. We suggest some directions for future research, and we also take seriously the role of discriminatory pay-setting at the top of the wage distribution.},

We find that younger households' participation decisions in assets are more responsive to income than older households. Family structure plays a significant role in explaining cross-country differences for both cohorts. Examining institutional differences, we find that in more financially developed and economically open countries, households are less likely to own housing but more likely to be in debt. Typical mortgage characteristics and mathematical literacy are also correlated with debt participation across countries. These findings have important implications for policy setting during times of financial unease for the young, as well as for the future in helping secure adequate income for the elderly. Our results show that there is scope for policies which promote asset participation for young households and debt participation, where there is a need for consumption smoothing, for older households.},
