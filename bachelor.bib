  abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the long-run evolution of wealth inequality in Germany. We combine tax data, surveys, national accounts and rich lists to study the distribution of wealth in Germany from 1895 to 2018. We show that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1\% has fallen by half,from close to 50\% in 1895 to less than 25\% today.The interwar period as well as World War II and its aftermath stand out as the great equalizers in 20th century German history.Since unification, two off-setting trends have shaped the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising equity valuations that were counterbalanced by large middle-class capital gains from rising house prices. Since 1993, wealth of the top 10\% and of the middle class(50-90\%) approximately doubled in real terms. However, these asset price induced gains in business and housing wealth almost entirely by-passed households in the bottom half of the wealt distribution who do not own these assets. Wealth of the bottom 50\% of the population has stagnated since 1993 and their share in total wealth has nearly halved. The wealth gap between households in the bottom and the upper half has widened significantly. In 1993, households in the top 10\% were about 50 times richer than households in the bottom half. Today, they are 100 times richer. Finally,we also show that official statistics underestimate privately held German business wealth and real estate wealth.},

In the change decomposition, methods are presented to break down the contribution of each explanatory factor into a coefficients effect, a correlation effect, and a standard deviation effect.

This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970--2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1\% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one's labor income only.},

This paper demonstrates that the true optimal solution to the SCM problem is typically a corner solution where all weight is assigned to a single predictor, contradicting the intended purpose of predictors. To address this inherent design flaw, we propose to determine the predictor weights and donor weights separately. We show how the donor weights can be optimized when the predictor weights are given, and consider alternative data-driven approaches to determine the predictor weights. Re-examination of the two original empirical applications to Basque terrorism and California's tobacco control program demonstrates the complete and utter failure of the existing SCM algorithms and illustrates our proposed remedies.},

In this article, I introduce an alternative method that evaluates individuals' contributions to inequality as well as the between-group and within-group components of these individual contributions. I first highlight three common inequality measures, the Gini index and two generalized entropy measures---Theil's T and Theil's L indices---by presenting their individual components as a method for evaluating inequality. Five artificial data examples illustrate the use of these individual components first. An empirical analysis of the 2007 and 2017 Current Population Survey data then focuses on the differences in inequality revealed by such individual inequality components between the 2007 and 2017. The individual-level inequality measures can reveal patterns of inequality concealed by single measures at the aggregate level. In particular, the Gini individual measures differentiate cases better than the generalized entropy measures and tend to have smaller standard errors in a regression analysis.},

I then develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation that makes it possible to disentangle the importance of differences in rates of return, savings, labor incomes and portfolio choices across wealth groups in explaining wealth inequality dynamics. My analysis documents that top wealth holders time better the market, saving a larger share on housing during booms and reshuffling their portfolio away from housing towards financial assets at the beginning of busts. Counterfactual simulations show that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is the only channel that contributed to reducing the bottom 50\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. Finally, I document that this heterogeneity in portfolio choices is consistent with the existence of large differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups, mainly coming through differences in the composition of housing. Taken together, these results reveal that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is an important driver of short to medium term fluctuations of wealth inequality.},

Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures---confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality---an increase in recipients of `large' inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what `large' means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. We find that transfers above the ninety-fifth percentile of the national transfer distribution are generally associated with an increasing effect on wealth inequality. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.},
