## Literature

This thesis builds on the effort to collect detailed data on wealth distribution and inequality. Pioneered by @pikettyIncomeInequalityUnited2003 and followed by his seminal book [@pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014], it reinvigorated the analysis of inequality in economics and inspired the creation of distributional national accounts [^l1]. These datasets aim to link up national accounts with survey data to ensure macroeconomic consistency of inequality estimates. First presented for the US Income Distribution by @pikettyDistributionalNationalAccounts2018 and Wealth Distribution by @batty22DistributionalFinancial2022, they are now available as well for european income distributions [@blanchetHowUnequalEurope2019] and wealth distributions [@blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024]. The latter is the main dataset used in this thesis, further explored in @sec-data.

The analysis is most closely related to the literature researching asset prices as a central driver of wealth inequality. @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020 use a newly construced historical dataset ranging back to 1948 to document the reactions of different parts of the wealth distribution to stock and house prices [- @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020, p.37]. They find that the share of the top decile of the wealth distribution reacts negatively to increases in house prices and the opposite with respect to stock prices, mostly due to differential exposure in Household portfolios [- @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020, p.34]. Additionally, they find that the portfolio valuation channel is predominantly responsible for shifts in the wealth distribution, especially in the lower half [- @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020, p.42]. A similar analysis is done by @adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016, who multiply different asset valuations in european household portfolios by a 10% price increase [-@adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016, p.3]. The authors document an increase in wealth inequality in response to rising stock prices and a decrease in response to housing price apprecations, although with a large heterogeneity across the Euro Area for the latter. @martinez-toledanoHousePriceCycles2022 finds similar efffects, focusing on the relation of House Price Cycles and wealth inequality in spain. She puts a special emphasis on the differential effects in boom and busts and the role of portfolio adjustments by richer Households. 

As described above, differential portfolio choice explains the effect of valuation changes on inequality. @coccoPortfolioChoicePresence2005 presents a theoretical model of optimal portfolio allocation to explain why younger and poorer households invest in housing and do not take part in the stock market. @sierminskaOwnNotOwn2013 document these differences for age cohorts empirically across European and North American countries, highlighting the role of institutions in portfolio choices. A description of household balance sheets across socio-economic groups is provided by @causaHousingWealthAccumulation2019 for OECD Countries. 



[^l1]: The measurement of Housing Capital by Piketty was criticised by @bonnetDoesHousingCapital2014, who find that using rent as a housing capital measurement, Piketty's fast rising capital-income ratios are actually stable. @allegreDoesHousingWealth2015 outline internal incosistencies in their critique while emphasizing the central contribution of housing in explaining the wealth dynamics. A summary of the role of housing in the debate around Piketty's work is provided by @stephensPikettyInequalityHousing2017.
