### D: Inequality Housing Prices

- relationship between housing prices and inequality
- higher net wealth inequality in 2011 -> higher housing price growth in subsequent decade

Regression

$$
\Delta \text{Housing Prices}_{2011,2021} = \beta_0+\beta_1 \text{Gini}_{2011} + \epsilon
$$

```
../output/table_hp_ineq.tex
```

Results

- no significant relationship
- low R2
- also confirmed when plotting

```
../output/hp_ineq.png
```

- countries with similar ineq (GR, MT)
- one had very strong growth, other HP declined
- if there was a substantial relationship, not visible in the data
