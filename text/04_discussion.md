## Discussion

**Endogeneity Concern**

- what if Wealth inequality drives housing prices
- higher inequality = more disposable wealth to invest
- leads to higher housing prices = market heating up
- Example: @godaAbsoluteIncomeInequality2020
  - Inequality drives up housing prices
  - raising aggregate demand 
  - top income shares induced
  - OECD countries 
  - income inequality! 
  



Counter

- short / medium run analysis (only 10 years)
- not much change in home ownership rate
- argument: 
  - if level of inequality made a difference
  - then countries with higher inequality would have seen a larger price increase
  - simple regression (APPENDIX) does not confirm
  - country like GR, SK = similar gini
  - but one vast increases in prices, other not
- saw in figure HP, that regions had a similar trajectory
  - eastern regions similar, southern regions similar
- assumption of endogeneity = ok
  - HW = closely related to valuation of stock = HP -> Wealth




**Stoxx 50** as Stock Price Indicator

- not accurate represenation of stock market for most countries
- assumes all invest the same
- Stoxx Market 600 (broader representation)

counter:

- Stoxx Europe 600 
  - largest = UK firms
  - not in Eurozone, not included in DWA
- Stoxx 50 = 60% of capitalization
- 98% correlation ([Source](https://stoxx.com/under-the-spotlight-a-closer-look-at-european-equities/))
- different stock portfolios in different countries
  - possible
  - local stock markets = tightly integrated (stock market integration)
  - @kimDynamicStockMarket2005 for 15 member states before 2004
  - @savvaStockMarketIntegration2010 for new member states after 2004
  - comovement of local with european market




**mechanical correlation**

- Concern: House Price Data on RHS = Housing Wealth Level on LHS
- mechanical correlation
- Counter: 
  - Share of Wealth held by groups, not total level
  - calcualtion in QSA= multi sources, a lot of modeling and calibration to fit to QSA
- Noted, but no



**Drivers of**: rising Housing Wealth

is it driven by higher prices or more savings?

- 





- gini coefficient of income = down
- short time frame = probably not possible for doubling of wealth in 2011-2021
- Literature @knollNoPriceHome2017
  - valuatio channel over the 70 years = half
  - Differential, lower deciles = more than upper (long term)







Savings vs Valuation Effect



Counter:

- Declinining INcome Inequality
  - Top 10% not much differential savings
- stable savings rate



Society: W = P x Q

Individual: $\Delta$ W = W * P + $\Delta$ S

---





**Long Term Effects** 

short term good for middle + lower class (in most countires), but what about long term?



- higher prices = less affordability of housing for first buyers
  - @bonnetRisingInequalitiesAccess2019 for France
  - age groups itself not changing share of HO
    - but intra age group inequality rising
  - higher role of inheritances (very unequal) @engelhardtIntergenerationalTransfersBorrowing1998
- higher prices = higher rents 
  - no ability to save for tenants, rental income to landlords (often in top10)
  - distinction between have / have nots (Tenant Wealth Gap)

```
PLOT: Tenant Wealth Gap
```

- rising ratio of owner net wealth - tenant net wealth
- rising housiing prices = make it even more difficult
- climb the property ladder = impossible 
- between group inequality @kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019

further research needed (microdata, historical data)



**Role of mortages**

- not directly analysed in this thesis
- mortages / leverage = play a major role in housing markets
- leverage differs considerably across countries
  - regulatory regimes
  - cultures
- contribution to inequality has to be asessed





**Insititutional**

- why do the responses differ in countries? to same shock
- = different portfolios 
- why do these differ? instituional differences
- central role = homeownership, (part of the property ladder)
- National housing policy = drives these decisions
  - credit access 
  - tax incentinves for ownership
  - rental market structure
  - market regulation on prices

@kaas

```
The authors also stress the importance of differential homeownership rates as a determinant of the level of wealth inequality across Europe. It is highly negatively correlated with inequality, e.g Germany with one of the lowest homeownership rates exhibits one of the highest gini coefficients. However, this variation cannot be attributed to demographic differences alone. Instead, institutional factors play a central role in shaping ownership structures.
```





**Policy Implications**

european monetary policy

- 2011-2021 = period with expansive monetary policy
- some say: drove asset price valuation
  - housing as well as stocks
  - @bernankeWhatExplainsStock2005 US Stocks 
  - @vargas-silvaMonetaryPolicyUS2008 US housing of Contraction
  - EU 
- drives housing price valuations => different distributional effects in countries



Monetary policy 

- Stocks:

  - Conventional: rate cuts = increase prices @bernanke
  - unconventional: stock buying programs = boost equity prices @fratzscherECBUnconventionalMonetary2016

- Housing:

  - contraction: negatively affects prices @coenMonetaryShocksHouse2024 Europe 
  - but also heterogenous across Europe @noceraHousePricesMonetary2018

- period 2011-2022

  - Euro Crisis
  - "whatever it takes"
  - unconvetnial moentary policy, bought commercial assets
  - while housing rpices = declining 






Home ownership rates , drivers

- bourassaDeterminantsHomeownershipRate2015: overview paper
- choTaxTreatmentOwner2011: preferential tax treatment
- kindermann kohls: better rental market = lower HO
- kaas first paper
  - imputed rent taxation
  - interest rate deduction
- kaasLowHomeownershipGermany2021: structural model to explain Germanys low HO rate
  - mortgage interest rate deductions
- all in all: complicated, diverse distributional consequences
  - e.g. mortgage interest rate tax deductions: 
- higher HO = not always good 
  - higher savings
  - reduced labor mobility







role of leverage:

- @causaHousingWealthAccumulation2019
  - heterogeneity in leverage, especially housing debt
  - countries with loan to value ratios above 50% (NL, IE)
  - especially at lower part of the distribution
- opens up to gains if prices icnrease
- but expoe to risks
  - if prices fall
  - or interest rates rise in countries with variable interest rates
- diverse role in countries = could explain the reactins
- further research needed for europe in connection to housing prices + wealth inequality









## Conclusion





thesis:

- examine inequality reaction to asset prices in europe
- direct consequences
  - middle and lower class wealth = sensitive to house prices
  - upper class = stock prices
- Gains = shift the wealth dsitrbution without chagnes in savings / income distribution
- diverse 



literatue:

- determinants of wealth inequality: asset prices
- central = housing
- contributes to this: higher frequency data, from novel dataset DWA
- valuation effects = important to dynamics, not only savings / income



further research

- decomposing savings / valuation effects
- role of leverage
- heterogenous analysis for individual countries
- determinants of wealth inequality look



implications

- housing policy regimes
- monetary policy
