## Discussion

**Endogeneity Concern**

- what if Wealth inequality drives housing prices
- higher inequality = more disposable wealth to invest
- leads to higher housing prices = market heating up
- Example: @godaAbsoluteIncomeInequality2020
  - Inequality drives up housing prices
  - raising aggregate demand 
  - top income shares induced
  - OECD countries 
  - income inequality! 
  



Counter

- short / medium run analysis (only 10 years)
- not much change in home ownership rate
- argument: 
  - if level of inequality made a difference
  - then countries with higher inequality would have seen a larger price increase
  - simple regression (APPENDIX) does not confirm
  - country like GR, SK = similar gini
  - but one vast increases in prices, other not
- saw in figure HP, that regions had a similar trajectory
  - eastern regions similar, southern regions similar
- assumption of endogeneity = ok
  - HW = closely related to valuation of stock = HP -> Wealth




**Stoxx 50** as Stock Price Indicator

- not accurate represenation of stock market for most countries
- assumes all invest the same
- Stoxx Market 600 (broader representation)

counter:

- Stoxx Europe 600 
  - largest = UK firms
  - not in Eurozone, not included in DWA
- Stoxx 50 = 60% of capitalization
- 98% correlation ([Source](https://stoxx.com/under-the-spotlight-a-closer-look-at-european-equities/))
- different stock portfolios in different countries
  - possible
  - local stock markets = tightly integrated (stock market integration)
  - @kimDynamicStockMarket2005 for 15 member states before 2004
  - @savvaStockMarketIntegration2010a for new member states after 2004
  - comovement of local with european market




**mechanical correlation**

- Concern: House Price Data on RHS = Housing Wealth Level on LHS
- mechanical correlation
- Counter: 
  - Share of Wealth held by groups, not total level
  - calcualtion in QSA= multi sources, a lot of modeling and calibration to fit to QSA
- Noted, but no



**Drivers of**: rising Housing Wealth

is it driven by higher prices or more stock?

- price effect
  - no change in stock
  - change of prices of existing Houses
- quantity effect
  - changes in stock / ownership
  - independent of HP
  - Counter: 
    - Stock did not grow much in Europe
    - HO did not change much in Europe Countries
    - not able to explain the changes

Literature @knollNoPriceHome2017

- most is valuation channel, especially for lower deciles



therefore: main focus: valuation channel





**Long Term Effects** 

short term good for middle + lower class (in most countires), but what about long term?



- higher prices = less affordability of housing for first buyers
  - @bonnetRisingInequalitiesAccess2019 for France
  - age groups itself not changing share of HO
    - but intra age group inequality rising
  - higher role of inheritances (very unequal)
- higher prices = higher rents 
  - no ability to save for tenants, rental income to landlords (often in top10)
  - distinction between have / have nots (Tenant Wealth Gap)

```
PLOT: Tenant Wealth Gap
```

- rising ratio of owner net wealth - tenant net wealth
- rising housiing prices = make it even more difficult
- climb the property ladder = impossible

further research needed (microdata, historical data)
