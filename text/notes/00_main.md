# Introduction



Housing as central asset of the 90%

- central for the analysis of population wide inequalities
- Largest part of net worth in europe (MAP)



weath = depends on valuation of existing stock

- rising prices for asset classes = shifts in distribution 
- without any asset changing hands



intersection of 2 topics

- composition + leverage of portfolios along distribution differ
- identical asset price movements = different effects on different segments
- focus on housing prices 





my question 

- research the question: *what effect do rising house prices have on the distribution of wealth*?
  - measured in share of wealth oftop10, m40, b50
- do these effects differ across european countries:
  - portfolio composition + intra-asset inequalities differ considerably
  - *Does this lead to different reactions to the same shocks?*
- counterfactual simulation
  - *how would the european countries look like, if they had the same reactions?*





structure

- review literature
- explain the data + descriptive statistics
- expand on methodology / empirical strategy
- first question: panel regression
- going on to: individual time series regressions
- then: counterfactual simulation
- concludig with: discussion + conclusion
