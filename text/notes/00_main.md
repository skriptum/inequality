Abstract:

- What are the distributional consequences of house prices?
- this thesis: 
  - recent cycles in Europe after Financial Crisis
  - asset gains. especially housing, as consequences on wealth distribution
- employ: newly DWA
  - shot term, high quality
- results
  - first order consequences
  - stock prices = positive
  - house prices = negative for top wealth
- document:
  - large heterogeneity across european countries
  - subsumed under averages
- simulate
  - wealth shares under different scenarios
- taken together: 



Notes:

- Data set quality
  - Wealth Tax Data (Denmark, Switzerland)
  - Would alleviate concerns about underreporting of top wealth
  - top 1% effect: again different, needs more inclusiveness
- Literature Housing
- Discussion: 
  - situate findings in literature
  - simulation: consequences for real world
    - no scenario with these high ratios of HP to SP






# Introduction



Housing as central asset of the 90%

- central for the analysis of population wide inequalities
- Largest part of net worth in europe (MAP)



weath = depends on valuation of existing stock

- rising prices for asset classes = shifts in distribution 
- without any asset changing hands



intersection of 2 topics

- composition + leverage of portfolios along distribution differ
- identical asset price movements = different effects on different segments
- focus on housing prices 





my question 

- research the question: *what effect do rising house prices have on the distribution of wealth*?
  - measured in share of wealth oftop10, m40, b50
- do these effects differ across european countries:
  - portfolio composition + intra-asset inequalities differ considerably
  - *Does this lead to different reactions to the same shocks?*
- counterfactual simulation
  - *how would the european countries look like, if they had the same reactions?*





structure

- review literature
- explain the data + descriptive statistics
- expand on methodology / empirical strategy
- first question: panel regression
- going on to: individual time series regressions
- then: counterfactual simulation
- concludig with: discussion + conclusion
