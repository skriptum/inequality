general inequality data effort

- @pikettyIncomeInequalityUnited2003 US
- followed by widely received book @pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014
- collected in WID @alvaredoDistributionalNationalAccounts2020
  - sparked a multi country effort to collect top wealth data, e.g. Germany: @bartelsTopIncomesGermany2019



*inspired creation of*

new distributional accounts

- aim: link up national accounts with survey data (macro consistent)
- wealth (US):
  - current: @batty22DistributionalFinancial2022
  - historic: @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020
- income: @pikettyDistributionalNationalAccounts2018
- EU:
  - income: @blanchetHowUnequalEurope2019
  - wealth @blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024
    - central dataset used in this analysis







*understand drivers:*

general:

- channels: [@blanchetWealthInequalityDynamics2023, p.29]
  - labor income 
  - savings rate
  - capital gains,
- inequalities in these: shape wealth inequality
  - higher income inequality c.p. -< more wealth accumulation
  - higher asset prices = higher capital gains = inequality
  
- compare and analyze drivers of wealth ineuqliaty
  - ling run: EUR + US






Asset prices as driver of wealth inequality

- @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020: Middle Class: positive Housing Reactions, negative Stock (US, historic)	
  - especially bottom 50%: valuation = 90% of hitoric wealth growth
- @martinez-toledanoHousePriceCycles2022: spain: busts negative for Middle class, top = reshiftign portfolio
- @adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016: different capital gains, euro area countries, accounting exercise
- @bonnetDoesHousingCapital2014: response to Piketty: wealth income ratios driven by housing equity, not wealth per se





*closely related to:*

HH Portfolio

- @causaHousingWealthAccumulation2019: OECD, Housing between groups
- @coccoPortfolioChoicePresence2005: modeling, investment in housing explains differences in portfolio choice
- @sierminskaOwnNotOwn2013: eu+us+canada, demographic charactersitics of Housing (focus: age)





*and different returns*

- @bachRichPickingsRisk2020 : swedish data, higher net wort = higher returns
- @fagerengHeterogeneityPersistenceReturns2020: norwegian data, in same asst classes D10 vs D01 different returns





*importance of housing for whole economy*

- long term data housing prices @knoll 
- drivers of housgin prices = credit @jordaLeveragedBubbles2015
-  increasing importance of housing credit in overall debt @jordaGreatMortgagingHousing2016





*Europen Lit*: explain Wealth Differences cross country

- Explanations (W INeq differ much from I Ineq.)
- @biewenShapeWealthDistribution2025: wealth differences EU: HO explains 
- @mathaHouseholdWealthEuro2017: HO, HP, Inheritances
- @pfefferWealthInequalityNations2021: central driver of housing equity in wealth ineq. (LIS)
- @kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019

  - HO: explains 
  - between group inequality: renter / tenants
  - driven by HH in lower half





methodological related:

- @wolffTopHeavyStudy1995 [p. 31, p. 77]

  - US analyis + regression: wealth share held by top 1% explained by
    - share of income
    - ratio of stocks / housing prices
  - ratio + income share explain the variation = statistically significant

- @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020

  - "race between the stock market and the housing market" [p. 37]
  - Regression: Top 10 % share ~ House Prices, stock Prices, income share
  - Result: negative to HP, positive to SP
- @fullerHousingPricesWealth2020 
  - for western europe and OECD countries: Panel Regression
  - Wealth to Income Ratios (Piketty) as Inequality measurement
    - House Prices and other Assets = explain most of the development
    - Homeownership

Contribute by: extending 

- european cross country
- for all wealth groups, not only top 10%
