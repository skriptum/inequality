## The Distributional Wealth Accounts {#sec-data}

To understand the wealth dynamics, the analysis employs a variety of different datasets, the main being the Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) compiled by the European Central Bank [@blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024]. The DWA provides quarterly household balance sheets, disaggregated into major asset classes, of different deciles of the wealth distribution.  It contains data for 21 countries, with coverage beginning in 2009 for the earliest countries and extending until 2025. 

A novelty of the DWA is their consistency with macroeconomic estimates of wealth from the quarterly financial accounts. A limitation of existing distributional data based only on surveys is the underreporting of wealth, which is adressed in the DWA following the US example by @battyDistributionalFinancialAccounts2022 for the Federal Reserve. Essentially, the approach is to correct for missing top households by oversampling at the upper end of the distribution, a point further explained below.

The exact methodology to derive quarterly distributional accounts is described by @engelDevelopingReconciledQuarterly2022. They distribute the wealth estimates from the quarterly sectoral financial accounts (QSA) according to the distribution in the Household Finance and Consumption Surveys (HFCS), which are carried out by Eurozone member banks every 3-4 years [@eurosystemhouseholdfinanceandconsumptionnetworkEurosystemHouseholdFinance2013]. To overcome the problems of differential nonresponse (richer Households are underrepresented in the surveys) and the differential underreporting (richer Households undervalue their assets) they use the method proposed by @vermeulenEstimatingTopTail2016. He builds on the finding that the upper tail of the wealth distribution follows a Pareto distribution, which can be used to create synthetic rich Households on a curve fitted to the HFCS data and Households from external rich lists (e.g. @nesshoeferRanglisteGroesstenVermoegen2024 for Germany). 

To compile quarterly time series in between the HFCS survey waves, @engelDevelopingReconciledQuarterly2022 use the linear interpolation developed by @kavoniusDerivingHouseholdIndebtedness2016. Additionally, they extrapolate the national accounts data after the most recent HFCS wave in 2022.

The authors perform a wide range of sensitivity and robustness checks for the DWA, but it is important to stress that it is still an experimental dataset, which can not guarantee the same accuracy as data obtained by wealth taxation or other methods.

This analysis draws on the DWA data until 2022. Potential extrapolation errors after the last HFCS wave and lagged effects of the Covid shock on the housing market are therefore not included in the dataset. The full range of countries is used, including Hungary, which is not part of the Eurozone, but increases the reliability of the results. The countries are abbreviated in Figures and Tables by their ISO 2-digit country codes. A table with descriptive statistics and their respective full name is provided in @tbl-descriptive in Appendix B. 

Furthermore, assets are combined to simplify and ease the interpretation of results [as in @kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019]. Unlisted shares and non-financial business wealth are combined to form business wealth. Debt securities, listed shares, investment fund shares, and life insurance entitlements form financial wealth. Debt is composed of mortgage loans and other loans.

Additionally, the wealth estimates for Deciles 6 to 9 are combined to form the middle 40%, alongside the bottom 50% and top 10% (hereafter, the wealth groups). This follows the literature (e.g @pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014, @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020), as the middle 40% have distinct portfolio compositions and wealth levels from the other groups (see @fig-portfolio). Their wealth is predominantly made up of housing equity, whereas business and financial assets play a much larger role in the top decile.

For house price data, the Residential Property Price Dataset from the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) is used [@scatignaResidentialPropertyPrice2014]. The dataset is widely employed in cross country comparisons [i.e. @runstlerBusinessHousingCredit2018] and includes quarterly house price indices for all countries covered in the analysis. 

House prices in the eurozone plateaued until 2015 and then increased significantly, as shown in @fig-prices. However, there are significant differences among the individual member states. Southern European countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece experienced a devaluation after 2010, while many Western and Eastern European countries showed strong increases. Estonia and Luxembourg saw their price indices almost double during this period, while Greece's declined by 25 index points.

Stock prices are represented using the Euro Stoxx 50 index, which includes the 50 largest firms in the Eurozone. They stem from 11 Eurozone countries, offering broad representation of the region’s equity markets. The index captures approximately 60% of total market capitalization and serves as a standard benchmark for European stock market performance [e.g @brechmannRiskManagementHighdimensional2013].

The final panel dataset includes asset holdings for the three wealth groups in 21 countries as well as the Eurozone as an aggregate, measured in nominal values. The number of observations per country ranges from 17 in Latvia to 49 in Greece, totaling 860 observations. This is complemented by house price indices for all countries over the observed time frames and the European stock price index.

After presenting the data sources used in the analysis, the next section provides some stylized facts and descriptive statistics drawn from the DWA.

## Stylized Facts about the Wealth Distribution {#sec-descriptive}

Wealth inequality reflects not only differences in levels but also in portfolio composition. The following descriptive evidence shows how assets are distributed across groups in the euro area, highlighting the structural differences that shape responses to price shocks.

@fig-portfolio shows the composition of household portfolios across the wealth distribution. Housing dominates for all but the top decile, making up around two-thirds to three-quarters of total wealth. The middle 40% in particular (deciles 6–9) display very similar portfolios, heavily concentrated in housing with modest holdings in deposits and only limited exposure to financial or business assets. As wealth rises, however, other asset classes gradually gain weight: deposits and financial assets increase in the upper deciles, and business wealth becomes substantial only for the top 10%.

These aggregate patterns mask considerable heterogeneity across countries. The portfolios of the bottom 50% display the greatest variation in composition[^d1]. In many cases, their holdings resemble those of the middle class, with housing as the main asset (e.g., Italy, Ireland, and Finland). In others, such as Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, housing plays a far smaller role, contributing less than half of total wealth.

[^d1]: The complete breakdown for all european countries is provided in @fig-portfolio-indiv in Appendix C.

@fig-distribution shows how different asset classes are distributed across the wealth groups in the Eurozone. Housing wealth is the most evenly distributed, with the top 10% holding 47% of the total. Net wealth as a whole is somewhat more concentrated, with 57% in the top decile. The concentration is much stronger for financial wealth and business wealth, where the top decile controls 72% and 85% respectively. This highlights that while housing provides a broader base of wealth across the population, financial and business assets are largely restricted to the very top of the distribution.

This sequence holds in all european countries, with the absolute numbers differing considerably[^d2]. While almost all financial wealth is owned by the top decile in Croatia and Greece, it is less than half in the Netherlands and Malta. For business wealth, the most significant share held by the top 10% is in Austria and Germany, while Greece and Cyprus feature the most equal distribution. In housing wealth, it is not the share of the top 10% that varies much, but the bottom 50%. In Germany, Austria and the Netherlands they possess below 2% of the asset, while their counterparts in Slovakia and Lithuania own more than 15%.

@fig-trends tracks the portfolios of the wealth groups over the observed time frame. The figure confirms the large heterogeneity of wealth portfolios in the literature and additionally adds a time dimension displaying the diffferent growth trends of net wealth.

The lower half of the distribution have little wealth, with housing and deposits playing the largest role. They are highly leveraged and essentially did not increase their net wealth until 2015, after which it grew slowest of all groups. The portfolio of the middle 40% is dominated by housing. Compared to the bottom 50%, they exhibit much higher net wealth and much lower debt. In the top decile, Business as well as Financial Wealth play a larger role, while debt plays a smaller one. The net wealth of the top 10% grew fastest, from 539 thousand euros to 849 thousand euros per capita, a 57% increase in the span of 12 years.

These differences in portfolio size and composition suggest that changes in asset prices are likely to affect each segment of the distribution differently. The next section sets out the econometric framework used to quantify these effects.
