## Discussion

The empirical results provide a first indication of how asset prices correlate with changes in wealth distribution across Europe.

One theoretical concern is reverse causality: rather than asset prices driving shifts in wealth inequality, it is plausible that changes in the wealth distribution affect asset price dynamics themselves. Higher inequality leads to more disposable wealth accruing at the top, which in turn could lead to more investment in financial assets and housing, therefore raising prices in a supply-constrained environment. @godaAbsoluteIncomeInequality2020 use cointegration tests to find that absolute income inequality and housing prices are positively correlated in OECD countries, suggesting that inequality itself can fuel price growth.

Given the relatively short time frame of the analysis and its focus on wealth inequality, it is unlikely that long-run structural shifts in inequality have been the main driver of housing prices. If the argument holds, countries with higher inequality at start would have seen a stronger price increase than the ones with lower inequality. Empirically, this does not seem to be the case, as presented in Figure @fig-reverse in Appendix F. The relationship between initial inequality and subsequent housing price growth is weak and inconsistent across periods. In particular, countries with higher Gini coefficients in 2014 or 2019 did not systematically experience higher housing price growth over the following five years.

The literature on drivers of housing prices also emphasises the role of exogenous factors [@ducaWhatDrivesHouse2021]. Especially important are financial constraints, e.g. interest rates and borrowing regulation, as well as feedback loops driving endogenous cycles. The authors also stress the diverse regional trajectories and institutions governing house prices. To conclude, shifts in housing wealth are directly influenced by housing prices trough the valuation channel, while the arguments for a reverse relationship are not as clear.

Another potential issue is the use of the Stoxx 50 as a stock price index. As an european average, it cannot capture the individual stock market conditions in european countries, therefore assuming all portfolios move in an identical manner.

On the other hand, the broadness of the index ensures that over 60% of the european capitalization is accounted for. Additionally, the local markets in the European Union are highly integrated into the european market. As @kimDynamicStockMarket2005 describes for 15 member states before 2004 and @savvaStockMarketIntegration2010 for new member states after 2004, there are significant comovements of local and european stock prices. Using local stock indices therefore would not yield different results and introduce a range of new problems concerning comparability.

A key limitation of the DWA is that it does not differentiate between the valuation and savings when measuring changes in wealth. An increase could be driven by changes to the valuation of the existing stock as well as increased savings of wealth segments. This is especially important if rising earnings inequality leads to more disposable income in the upper part of the wealth distribution, which is invested in assets. Rising Income Inequality would lead to rising wealth inequality in this scenario without changes in asset valuations.
