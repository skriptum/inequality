## Discussion {#sec-discussion}

The empirical results provide a first indication of how asset prices correlate with changes in wealth distribution across Europe.

One theoretical concern in the regression is reverse causality: rather than asset prices driving shifts in wealth inequality, it is plausible that changes in the wealth distribution affect asset price dynamics themselves. Higher inequality leads to more disposable wealth accruing at the top, which in turn could lead to more investment in financial assets and real estate, therefore raising prices in a supply-constrained environment. @godaAbsoluteIncomeInequality2020 use cointegration tests to find that absolute income inequality and house prices are positively correlated in OECD countries, suggesting that inequality itself can fuel price growth.

Given the relatively short time frame of the analysis and its focus on wealth inequality, it is unlikely that long-run structural shifts in inequality have been the main driver of rising house prices. If the argument holds, countries with higher inequality at start would have seen a stronger price increase than the ones with lower inequality. Empirically, this does not seem to be the case, as presented in Figure @fig-reverse in Appendix G. The relationship between initial inequality and subsequent house price growth is weak and inconsistent across periods. In particular, countries with higher Gini coefficients in 2014 or 2019 did not systematically experience higher house price growth over the following five years.

The literature on drivers of rising property values emphasises the role of other factors [@ducaWhatDrivesHouse2021]. Especially important are financial constraints, e.g. interest rates and borrowing regulation, as well as feedback loops driving endogenous cycles. The authors also stress the diverse regional trajectories and institutions governing house prices. In sum, while house prices clearly drive shifts in housing wealth and its distribution through the valuation channel, the evidence for a consistent reverse effect from wealth inequality to price growth is limited in this context.



Another potential issue is the use of the Stoxx 50 as a stock price index. As an european average, it cannot capture the individual stock market conditions in european countries, therefore assuming all portfolios move in an identical manner.

On the other hand, the broadness of the index ensures that over 60% of the european market capitalization is accounted for. Additionally, the local stock markets in the European Union are highly integrated into the european market. As @kimDynamicStockMarket2005 describes for 15 member states before 2004 and @savvaStockMarketIntegration2010 for new member states after 2004, there are significant comovements of local and european stock prices. Using local stock indices therefore would not yield significantly different results and introduce a range of new problems concerning comparability.

A key limitation of the DWA is that it does not differentiate between the valuation effect and savings effect when measuring changes in wealth. An increase in a given groups net wealth could be driven by changes to the valuation of the existing portfolios as well as increased savings of households. This is especially important if rising earnings inequality leads to more disposable income in the upper part of the wealth distribution, which is invested in assets. In this case, rising income inequality would lead to a larger share of wealth owned by the top decile, independent of changes in asset valuations.

@kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020 document the effects for the US distribution. They find that in the four decades preceding the 2008 financial crisis, the valuation effect played a similar role to savings in the development of the wealth distribution [@kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020, p. 41]. It is especially pronounced for the bottom half, where over 90% of the groups wealth growth is induced by changes in the valuation of assets, especially housing. In the period after the financial crisis, US house prices plummeted while stock prices quickly rebounded. The authors find that this led to a stark decrease in wealth owned by the bottom 90%, while the top 10% wealth grew due to the stock prices. As a result, the US saw the strongest increase in wealth concentration in post-war history, all the while income inequality remained stable. 

In the Eurozone, a similar picture emerges. Wealth inequality increased over the observed period (2011-2022), while income inequality decreased slightly [@eurostatGiniCoefficientEquivalised2024]. This suggests that valuation effects are primarily responsible for the wealth growth, and savings play a smaller role. Furthermore, given that the temporal frame of the observation is limited to a brief period, it is more plausible to attribute the increase in net wealth to asset prices.

In addition to the short-term consequences of asset prices on inequality, it is important to consider the second-order effects. Rising house prices without corresponding income increases reduce the affordability of owning a house, especially for first time buyers. This could lead to higher wealth inequality in the long term, as lower income and wealth groups are increasingly excluded from accumulating housing assets and thus miss out on the associated wealth gains.

Empirical evidence of this phenomenon is presented by @bonnetRisingInequalitiesAccess2019 for France. They find that in the last 40 years, low-income households between 25 and 44 years exhibited a decline in their homeownership rates, with the reverse for high-income households. In 1973, in the former group 34% of households owned their home, while in the latter it was 43%. This gap widened in the following decades, with 66% of the high income group owning their residence, while the percentage of the low income group more than halved with 16%. Notably, the average homeownership rate remained relatively stable during this period. The authors attribute the rise in ownership inequality to increasing house prices, the subsequent growing importance of inheritances, and shifts in family structures.

Additionally, rising house prices often lead to higher rents, which further erodes affordability. As @hickHousingAffordabilityPoverty2024 document, housing cost burdens across Europe have become increasingly concentrated among renters in the private market. Higher rents reduce tenants' ability to save and often prevent them from accumulating wealth, while rental income flows to landlords, who are disproportionately in the top wealth deciles. This dynamic especially affects first-time homebuyers, as high rents make it harder to save for down payments, delaying homeownership and deepening the divide between those who have housing wealth and those who don't.

The divergence between the "haves" and "have-nots" is illustrated in the figure ratio. The graph illustrates the tenant-to-owner wealth ratio in European countries. In many countries, the ratio has increased sharply, indicating that homeowners have experienced much stronger wealth growth relative to renters. Croatia has the largest ratio, with homeowners owning approximately 20 times as much wealth as tenants, up from 10.23 in the second quarter of 2017.

This aligns with the argument proposed by @kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019, who employed a decomposition approach to analyze european wealth Gini coefficients, distinguishing between owner and tenant groups. Their analysis revealed that the between-group component contributed significantly to the overall inequality observed [-@kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019, p. 34]. 



The importance of asset ownership for inequality also matters in the context of monetary policy. Since monetary interventions strongly influence asset prices, their effects are transmitted differently to owners and non-owners, and across wealth groups more broadly.. Conventional policy tools, such as interest rate cuts, are known to increase equity valuations [@bernankeWhatExplainsStock2005]. Housing markets respond similarly: contractionary shocks have been shown to lower house prices in Europe [@coenMonetaryShocksHouse2024], although the effect is highly heterogeneous across countries [@battistiniNavigatingHousingChannel2025].

The observation period of this thesis (2011â€“2022) overlaps with a phase of historically low interest rates, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and the ECB's shift toward unconventional monetary policy. This included large-scale purchases of corporate and government securities, boosting equity prices, which quickly rebounded [@fratzscherECBUnconventionalMonetary2016]. House prices on the other hand plateaud until 2015, before rising, albeit much slower than stock prices.

Thus decisions taken in light of the euro crisis had direct consequences on the wealth distribution in Europe. Higher stock prices, coupled with stable house prices, resulted in an increase in capital gains for the top decile, while the rest of the population did not benefit in a similar fashion. @bernothECBAssetPurchases2016 described this theoretical consequence of the ECB purchasing programs, and more detailed empirical research on the heterogenous distributional effects is needed to incorporate it into monetary policy frameworks.



One question that arises from the individual results is why portfolios and subsequent reactions to asset price movements differ so strongly across Europe. What institutional and cultural differences explain the large variance?

Research points into the direction of home ownership as a central explanatory power. @mathaHouseholdWealthEuro2017 find that the home ownership rate in addition to house price dynamics explain more than 50% of the wealth differences in Europe, particularly in the middle part of the distribution. Similarly, @kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019 highlight that home ownership rates are strongly negatively related to wealth inequality in the 9 largest european countries. The authors also stress that the home ownership rate itself is higly endogenous and variations have to be explained by institutional and cultural differences.

Several institutions influencing home ownership decisions are analysed in the literature [for an overview see @bourassaDeterminantsHomeownershipRate2015]. @choTaxTreatmentOwner2011 focus on preferential tax treatment in the form of mortgage interest rate deductibility and missing taxation of imputed rents. They find that it provides a financial incentive to own instead of rent in the US case and has negative distributional effects. 

@kaasWealthInequalityHomeownership2019 additionally highlight the role of sales tax on homes and average downpayment requirements, which differ across Europe and explain part of the variation in homeownership rates. In a companion paper [@kaasLowHomeownershipGermany2021], the authors incorporate these factors into a structural model to explain the low german homeownership rate. Running counterfactual experiments, they show that reducing transfer taxes and implementing mortgage interest rate deductions would increase the share of homeowners, while reducing welfare, particularly for new entrants into the property market.

Therefore, it is important to note that while a higher homeownership rate may lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, it also introduces consequences regarding market efficiency and distribution. In addition to upper-income classes profiting more if the higher rate is achieved through preferential tax treatment, it also creates an incentive to over consume housing as an asset [@choTaxTreatmentOwner2011]. This creates a "lock in" effect for owners, decreasing residential mobility with adverse effects on the functioning of the labor market [@causaHousingWealthAccumulation2019].

Beyond differences in homeownership rates, variation in household leverage is another key factor shaping how house prices affect wealth inequality. As noted by @causaHousingWealthAccumulation2019, there is substantial heterogeneity in household leverage, particularly housing debt. In some countries, such as the Netherlands and Ireland, average loan-to-value ratios exceed 50%, with high leverage especially common in the lower part of the wealth distribution. This can amplify gains when house prices increase, but also exposes households to significant risks if prices fall or if interest rates rise, particularly in markets with variable-rate mortgages. 

Such differences in leverage profiles could help explain part of the cross-country heterogeneity in wealth share reactions found in the regressions. While @martinez-toledanoHousePriceCycles2020 touches on these dynamics for Spain [-@martinez-toledanoHousePriceCycles2020, p. 19], broader evidence for other European countries remains scarce. The DWA, with its coverage of housing and other forms of debt across all wealth deciles, offers a promising basis for extending this line of research.



Taken together, the discussion highlights the importance of asset prices, especially housing and equities, in shaping recent wealth dynamics across Europe. While short-term valuation effects appear to drive much of the observed inequality, their distributional consequences are mediated by national institutions, ownership structures, and policy regimes. The analysis also points to monetary policy as an indirect but powerful driver of wealth inequality, raising questions about the distributive impact of asset purchases and interest rate decisions. Given the data limitations and focus on a relatively short time frame, further research is needed to disentangle long-run structural drivers from price effects, and to assess how policy interventions can be designed to mitigate wealth concentration.

## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This thesis examined how wealth inequality in Europe responds to changes in asset prices. The analysis reveals clear and distinct patterns: the middle and lower parts of the distribution profit from increases in house prices, while the top decile benefits predominantly from growth in stock prices. 

The counterfactual simulations illustrate how different price paths would have reshaped the wealth distribution. They show that rising house prices can partly offset stock-driven concentration at the top, but even the strongest booms were insufficient to halt inequality.

The contribution of this thesis lies in combining the ECBâ€™s new Distributional Wealth Accounts with panel methods to capture both short-term valuation effects and heterogeneity across European countries. The results confirm that the valuation effects, particularly with respect to housing, are central drivers of wealth inequality.

The findings carry important implications for housing and monetary policy. Housing market regimes determine who can access the property ladder, while monetary policy decisions shape asset valuations and, through them, the distribution of wealth. Recognizing these channels is essential for understanding the broader consequences of policy interventions.

Finally, the analysis points to several avenues for further research. A deeper decomposition of savings and valuation effects would clarify their relative roles in driving inequality. The influence of leverage on wealth dynamics remains underexplored and could be investigated with the DWA. More detailed country-level studies are also needed to explain the heterogeneous effects of asset prices across institutional settings in Europe.
