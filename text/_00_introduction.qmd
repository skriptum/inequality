## Introduction

Housing is Europe's largest asset[^i1]. Its value is central to both household finances and the macroeconomy. Yet despite advances in the literature, there is still limited comparative evidence on the distributional consequences of housing wealth accumulation in Europe. This thesis draws on recent improvements in distributional data [@blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024] and methodological approaches developed for the United States [@kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020] to examine how the wealth distribution reacts to changes in house prices.

[^i1]: In all Eurozone countries, housing wealth represents more than 50% of net wealth (see @fig-map in Appendix A)

The importance of housing for the modern economy cannot be overstated: houses are the primary item on household balance sheets; mortgages make up the largest share of debt in developed economies [@jordaGreatMortgagingHousing2016]; and housing cycles play a central role in macroeconomic fluctuations [@cesa-bianchiHousingCyclesMacroeconomic2013], particularly apparent during and after the financial crisis of 2008.


At the same time, inequality has returned to the forefront of economic debate. Since Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century [@pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014], research on the distribution of wealth and income has expanded rapidly, supported by large-scale data initiatives such as WID.world [@alvaredoGlobalInequalityDynamics2017] and the creation of official distributional accounts in developed economies [e.g. @battyDistributionalFinancialAccounts2022].

Bringing these two strands together, this thesis investigates how changes in asset prices, particularly housing, affect the distribution of wealth in Europe. Because the composition of household portfolios differs across the population, identical price movements can have vastly different distributional consequences. While high-wealth households tend to hold more business and financial assets tied to stock market performance, middle- and lower-wealth households primarily own housing and often carry more leverage, making them more exposed to house price movements [@adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016].

This analysis relies on newly released Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) from the European Central Bank [@blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024]. The DWA combine detailed micro-level survey's of households balance sheets with data from national accounts, ensuring macro-consistent estimates while preserving detailed information about the distribution of assets. The result is a harmonised, cross-country dataset for the Eurozone that captures changes in the wealth distribution at a much higher frequency than traditional surveys, making it well-suited for analysing the distributional effects of asset price movements.

Building on the regression framework of @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020, who relate changes in US wealth shares to asset price movements using broad survey data over several decades, this thesis applies a higher-frequency and cross-country approach. Using the quarterly data from the DWA for all euro area countries from 2009â€“2022, it estimates panel models linking changes in the wealth shares of the bottom 50%, middle 40%, and top 10% respectively to movements in housing and equity prices. 

The results demonstrate the central role asset prices play in the evolution of wealth inequality. Rising House prices increase the share of the middle 40% and particularly the bottom 50% at the expense of the top decile. Conversely, increasing stock prices are found to benefit the top 10%, to the detriment of the rest of the population. Notably, these results vary strongly across european countries, reflecting differences in portfolio structures and institutional settings.

To further analyze the effects, counterfactual simulations explore how alternative asset price paths would have affected wealth shares in Europe. Scenarios with strong housing growth shift wealth away from the top 10% toward the middle and lower segments, while weak or falling house prices have the opposite effect. However, even in the most extreme housing boom observed, these appreciations cannot offset the gains of rising stock prices for the top decile. In no counterfactual scenario does the share of the top 10% decrease over the observed timeframe.

The rest of thesis is structured as follows. @sec-literature reviews the relevant research on wealth inequality, asset prices, and portfolio choice. @sec-data describes the Distributional Wealth Accounts and complementary data sources, while @sec-descriptive presents stylized facts and descriptive statistics derived from them, followed by the empirical strategy outlined in @sec-strategy. The main results are presented in two steps: @sec-panel reports panel regression results, while @sec-indiv explores national heterogeneity. Counterfactual scenarios are presented in @sec-simulation. @sec-discussion interprets the findings in the context of existing literature and policy debates, and @sec-conclusion concludes.
