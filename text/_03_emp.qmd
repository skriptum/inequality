## Empirical Strategy

As described above, different segments of the wealth distribution hold different portfolios, in size as well as in composition of asset classes. Their net wealth therefore reacts in distinct ways to identical changes in valuation of assets. This has a direct effect on the share of overall wealth held by the segment and consequently on general wealth inequality.

To estimate this response, a panel regression outlined in @eq-regression is estimated:

$$
\Delta \log (\omega_{i,t}^g) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta \log (p_{i,t}^h) + \beta_2 \Delta \log(p^s_{t})+ \epsilon_t
$$ {#eq-regression}

$\Delta \log$ is the first difference of the log, as in $\Delta \log (x_t) = \log(x_t) - \log(x_{t-1})$. $\omega_{i,t}^g$ is the wealth share of a wealth group $g$ (Bottom 50%, Middle 40%, Top 10%) in country $i$ in quarter $t$. $p^h$ describes the housing price index and $p^s$ the stock market index. $\epsilon_t$ is an error term. The resulting estimates can be interpreted as the elasticity of the groups wealth share with respect to asset prices [@wooldridgeIntroductoryEconometricsModern2013, p44]. 

Some regressions are extended to include country and time fixed effects. To control for seasonal patterns and macroeconomic shocks, one specification also includes separate fixed effects for each quarter and each year. Quarter fixed effects are defined as categorical indicators for Q1 to Q4, while year fixed effects cover the years 2011 to 2022, capturing annual shocks common across countries.

A potential concern with this type of panel structure is spatial dependence. As the cross-section of countries is not randomly sampled, they are subject to common unobserved and observed disturbances, which potentially bias the standard errors of the parameter estimations. To adress this issue, the standard errors are computed using the spatial correlation consistent (SCC) method by @driscollConsistentCovarianceMatrix1998. 

Another problem is the heterogeneity in responses subsumed under the parameter estimates in an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression. Due to differing portfolio compositions of the same wealth groups across Europe, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ will not have the same slope in all countries and their estimates will not be able to explain the large variation.

To adress this, the estimates are calculated with the mean group estimator (MGE) proposed by @pesaranEstimatingLongrunRelationships1995. This estimator allows for heterogeneity in individual coefficients and error terms by running separate regressions for each unit. Resulting estimates are averaged as $\hat{\beta}^{MG} = 1/N \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{\beta}_i$ [@milloPanelTimeSeries2018, p. 190]. 

The MGE requires that $T \ge p $ and $N$ and $T$ are sufficiently large. Using Monte Carlo simulations, @hsiaoBayesEstimationShortrun1999 find that $T=5$ leads to considerable estimation error, while $T=20$ yields reliable results. The DWA dataset places well within the recommended range for applying the MGE, with $N=21$ and $T$ ranging from 17 to 49 across countries

One specification of the MGE is demeaned cross-sectionally, which reduces the influence of common factors. It is comparable to Time Fixed Effects in an OLS estimate [@coakleyUnobservedHeterogeneityPanel2006]. Both the standard as well as the demeaned MGE use the implementation in R by @croissantPlmLinearModels2023.

Additionally, regressions are estimated separately for each country. This allows for the interpretation of country-specific responses to identical price movements and helps identify outliers. To address potential heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the time series, standard errors are computed using the Newey-West estimator [@neweyHypothesisTestingEfficient1987].



## Wealth Share Elasticities: Panel Regression

@tbl-panelT10 reports the results of the panel regression for the share of the Top 10%. The first column includes time fixed effects, which absorb the stock prices due to the identical nature of the index in every country. Column 2 drops the time fixed effects, and includes unit fixed effects, while the third specification adds year and quarter fixed effects to control for seasonality. Column 4 presents calculations using the Demeaned MGE, which again absorb the estimates for stock prices. Column 5 uses the standard MGE. A separate regression with year and quarter fixed effects is not included, as it is identical.

The top 10% wealth share decreases in response to house price increases. The estimates are consistently negative in all specifications and statistically significant, ranging from -0.091 in the first column to -0.057 in the last and preferred specification. A 10% increase in House Prices leads to approximately a half percentage point decrease in the top decile wealth share. 

Rising stock prices are found to have an effect in the opposite direction. Estimates for the elasticity of the top decile wealth share range from 0.027 in the third specification and 0.014 in the last. An increase in stock prices increase the share of wealth hold by the Top 10%, while an increase in house prices compresses the share.

The OLS estimates for this as well as the other segments of the wealth distribution display a low coefficient of determination due to the heterogeneity in the data. Using the Mean Group Estimator, the models can explain above 20% of the variance in the standard configuration and above 30% in the demeaned configuration for all groups.

Contrasting effects to those of the top decile are identified for the Middle 40% (@tbl-panelM40). The elasticity of their wealth share with respect to house prices is positive, ranging from 0.058 in Model (1) to 0.031 in the preferred Model (5). An outlier is the estimate for the specification with Year and Quarter Fixed Effects, which is however not statistically significant. Stock prices on the other hand have a statistically significant negative effect on the middle segment of the wealth distribution. A 10% increase in stock prices leads to a decline in the share of net wealth of approximately 0.14 to 0.31 percentage points, depending on the specification.

The Bottom half of the wealth distribution responds similarly to the middle 40% in direction, albeit with greater magnitude. Estimates for the House Price elasticity range from 0.189 to 0.481. Conversely, accelerating stock prices by 10% decreases the share of the group by 0.28 percentage points to 0.51 percentage points.

This group is notable for its lack of statistical significance for most coefficient values, particularly in specifications that use the mean group estimator. As outlined above, it is the lower half that exhibits the most variation in their wealth portfolio and positions. Therefore, they will display the most variation in their response to price movements of their assets, which cannot be averaged without high standard errors.

## Country-Level Variation

To capture these heterogeneous effects, the regression is re-estimated separately for each country[^e0]. Figure @fig-coeffplot displays the resulting country-level coefficients for housing prices, ordered by magnitude and colored by statistical significance[^e1].

Visible in the panels is the large heterogeneity in all wealth segments. Estimates for the top decile range from -0.20 for Spain  to 0.19 for the Netherlands. The majority of the coefficients with statistical significance are negative, which confirms the results from @tbl-panelT10. For the middle 40%, the coefficients fall between -0.11 in the Netherlands and 0.13 in France, with a large share of countries for which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Results in the lower half of the wealth distribution exceed those of the other groups. The Netherlands has an estimated elasticity of -2.71, which indicates that a 1% increase in house prices decreases the share of net wealth held by that group by 2.7%. In contrast, they increase their share by 2.18% in Ireland in response to an identical increase in house prices.

@boelhouwerHousingMarketNetherlands2020 present explanations for the dutch outlier results. The social housing sector in the Netherlands is larger than in other european countries, promising affordable renting for poorer households. Additionally, new stricter mortgage lending requirements were implemented in 2011, reducing the ability of first time buyers to afford sufficient housing. This could explain the very low share of housing wealth owned by the bottom 50% documented in @fig-distribution-indiv and the negative effect in response to increasing house prices.



![House Price Coefficient Plots](../output/ts_tables/HP_coeff.png){#fig-coeffplot}

In general, the individual regressions support the panel model results. Accelerating stock prices profits the upper decile of the wealth distribution, at the expense of the rest of the population. House prices have a contrary effect, increasing the share of the bottom 50% and middle 40%. Statistical significance as well as $R^2$ varies due to heterogeneity in the responses in european countries.

To address the outlier effect of the Netherlands, the panel regressions are re-estimated excluding this country. Table @tbl-panelNL compares the results of the preferred specification using the standard mean group estimator with and without the Dutch data.

Excluding the Netherlands slightly reduces the magnitude of the coefficients for housing prices on the Top 10% and Middle 40%, but the signs and significance remain stable. For the Top 10%, the negative effect of house prices weakens from -0.057 to -0.069, while for the Middle 40%, the positive effect increases slightly and becomes more statistically significant.

The most notable change is for the bottom 50%. The coefficient on house prices increases from 0.253 to 0.395 and becomes statistically significant at the 1% level. This suggests that, once the outlier is removed, the effect of housing prices on the lower half of the distribution becomes clearer and more robust.

Stock price effects remain broadly stable across all specifications, with a significant positive effect on the Top 10% and a negative effect on the Middle 40%, consistent with prior estimates. No meaningful change is observed when the Netherlands is excluded

Overall, the results strengthen the interpretation that rising house prices tend to benefit the Bottom 50% and Middle 40%, while rising stock prices disproportionately benefit the Top 10%.
