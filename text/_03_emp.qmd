## Empirical Strategy {#sec-strategy}

As described above, different segments of the wealth distribution hold different portfolios, in size as well as in composition of asset classes. Their net wealth therefore reacts in distinct ways to identical changes in valuation of assets. This has a direct effect on the share of overall wealth held by the segment and consequently on general wealth inequality.

To estimate this response, a panel regression outlined in @eq-regression is estimated:

$$
\Delta \log (\omega_{i,t}^g) = \beta_0 + \beta_h \Delta \log (p_{i,t}^h) + \beta_s \Delta \log(p^s_{t})+ \epsilon_t
$$ {#eq-regression}

The resulting coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities, capturing the percentage change in a group’s wealth share associated with a one percent change in asset prices [@wooldridgeIntroductoryEconometricsModern2013, p. 44]. This makes the effects directly comparable across groups and asset classes. $\Delta \log$ is the first difference of the log, as in $\Delta \log (x_t) = \log(x_t) - \log(x_{t-1})$. $\omega_{i,t}^g$ is the wealth share of a wealth group $g$ (Bottom 50%, Middle 40%, Top 10%) in country $i$ in quarter $t$. $p^h$ describes the house price index and $p^s$ the stock market index. $\epsilon_t$ is an error term. 

Some regressions are extended to include country and time fixed effects. To control for seasonal patterns and macroeconomic shocks, one specification also includes separate fixed effects for each quarter and each year. Quarter fixed effects are defined as categorical indicators for Q1 to Q4, while year fixed effects cover the years 2011 to 2022, capturing annual shocks common across countries.

A potential concern with this type of panel structure is spatial dependence. As the cross-section of countries is not randomly sampled, they are subject to common unobserved and observed disturbances, which potentially bias the standard errors of the parameter estimations. To adress this issue, the standard errors are computed using the spatial correlation consistent (SCC) method by @driscollConsistentCovarianceMatrix1998. This estimator adjusts the covariance matrix to remain consistent in the presence of cross-sectional and temporal dependence.

Another problem is the heterogeneity in responses subsumed under the parameter estimates in an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression. Due to differing portfolio compositions of the same wealth groups across Europe, $\beta_h$ and $\beta_s$ will not have the same slope in all countries and their estimates will not be able to explain the large variation.

To adress this, the estimates are additionally calculated with the mean group estimator (MGE) proposed by @pesaranEstimatingLongrunRelationships1995. This estimator allows for heterogeneity in individual coefficients and error terms by running separate regressions for each unit. Resulting estimates are averaged as $\hat{\beta}^{MG} = 1/N \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{\beta}_i$ [@milloPanelTimeSeries2018, p. 190]. 

The MGE requires that $T \ge p$ and $N$ and $T$ are sufficiently large. Using Monte Carlo simulations, @hsiaoBayesEstimationShortrun1999 find that $T=5$ leads to considerable estimation error, while $T=20$ yields reliable results. The DWA dataset places well within the recommended range for applying the MGE, with $N=21$ and $T$ ranging from 17 to 49 across countries

One specification of the MGE is demeaned cross-sectionally, which reduces the influence of common factors. It is comparable to Time Fixed Effects in an OLS estimate [@coakleyUnobservedHeterogeneityPanel2006]. Both the standard as well as the demeaned MGE use the implementation in R by @croissantPlmLinearModels2023.

Additionally, regressions results are presented separately for each country. This enables the interpretation of country-specific responses to identical price movements and helps identify potential outliers. A challenge in real-world time series is that OLS residuals are often autocorrelated. This could result in biased estimates of the standard errors, as one of the core assumptions of the OLS estimator is not fulfilled. To address the autocorrelation and potential heteroskedasticity in the time series, standard errors are computed using the Newey-West estimator [@neweyHypothesisTestingEfficient1987]. This method corrects the standard errors by computing a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance matrix with a lag window to capture common disturbances [@pesaranTimeSeriesPanel2015, p. 113]. Lag length is selected automatically following @neweyAutomaticLagSelection1994, as implemented in R by @zeileisVariousVersatileVariances2020.

The following section applies this framework to estimate the relationship between asset price changes and wealth shares.

Top 10% Panel Regression
::::

@tbl-panelT10 reports the results of the panel regression for the share of the Top 10%. The first column includes time fixed effects, which absorb the stock price variation since the index is identical across all countries. Column 2 drops the time fixed effects and includes unit fixed effects, while the third specification adds year and quarter fixed effects to control for seasonality. Column 4 presents estimates using the demeaned MGE, which again absorbs the stock price index, and Column 5 reports the standard MGE. A separate regression combining year and quarter fixed effects with the standard MGE is not reported, as its results are identical to Column 5 due to the nature of the estimator. Including lags of the dependent variable does not materially alter the estimated effects; full results with lags are provided in @tbl-dynamic in Appendix E.

The top 10% wealth share decreases in response to house price increases. Across all specifications the coefficients are negative, with estimates ranging from –0.091 in Column (1) to –0.057 in the preferred Mean Group Estimator (Column 5). The effect is statistically significant in all but one specification, and robust to the inclusion of different fixed effects. The preferred specification is the standard MGE, as it allows for heterogeneous slopes across countries and avoids the bias of imposing a common response. The magnitude is economically meaningful: a 10% increase in house prices reduces the wealth share of the top decile by about half a percentage point, broadly consistent with evidence from @kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020 for the US.

Rising stock prices are found to have an effect in the opposite direction. Estimates for the elasticity of the top decile wealth share range from 0.027 in the third specification and 0.014 in the last. An increase in stock prices increase the share of wealth hold by the Top 10%, while an increase in house prices compresses the share.

The OLS estimates for all segments of the wealth distribution show a low explanatory power, reflecting the heterogeneity across countries. By contrast, the Mean Group Estimator captures this heterogeneity and substantially improves the fit, explaining over 20% of the variance in the standard specification and more than 30% in the demeaned version for all groups.

Middle 40% Panel Regression
::::



Contrasting effects to those of the top decile are identified for the Middle 40% (@tbl-panelM40). The elasticity of their wealth share with respect to house prices is positive, ranging from 0.058 in Model (1) to 0.031 in the preferred Model (5). An outlier is the estimate for the specification with Year and Quarter Fixed Effects, which is however not statistically significant. Stock prices on the other hand have a statistically significant negative effect on the middle segment of the wealth distribution. A 10% increase in stock prices leads to a decline in the share of net wealth of approximately 0.14 to 0.31 percentage points, depending on the specification.

The bottom half of the wealth distribution responds similarly to the middle 40%, albeit with a greater magnitude. Estimates for house price elasticity range from 0.189 to 0.481. Conversely, increasing stock prices by 10% decreases the group's share by 0.28 to 0.51 percentage points.

This group is notable for its lack of statistical significance for most coefficient values, particularly in specifications that use the mean group estimator. As outlined above, it is the lower half that exhibits the most variation in their wealth portfolio and positions. Therefore, they will display the most variation in their response to price movements of their assets, which cannot be averaged without substantial standard errors.

## Country-Level Variation {#sec-indiv}

To examine these heterogeneous effects across countries, the regression is re-estimated separately for each country following @eq-indiv. As mentioned above, the standard errors are heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent by use of the method of @neweyHypothesisTestingEfficient1987.

$$
\Delta \log (\omega_{t}^g) = \beta_0 + \beta_h \Delta \log (p_{t}^h) + \beta_s \Delta \log(p^s_{t})+ \epsilon_t
$$ {#eq-indiv}

@fig-coeffplot displays the resulting country-level coefficients for house prices for each segment of the wealth distribution[^e0]. Estimates are ordered by magnitude and colored by statistical significance, with their standard errors represented by the error bars[^e1].

[^e0]: Full regression tables are presented in Appendix D

[^e1]: A corresponding stock price coefficient plot is available in Appendix F.

Visible in the panels is the large heterogeneity in all wealth segments. Estimates for the top decile range from -0.20 for Spain  to 0.19 for the Netherlands. The majority of the coefficients with statistical significance are negative, which confirms the results from @tbl-panelT10. For the middle 40%, the coefficients fall between -0.11 in the Netherlands and 0.13 in France, with a large share of countries for which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Results in the lower half of the wealth distribution exceed those of the other groups. The Netherlands has an estimated elasticity of -2.71, which indicates that a 1% increase in house prices decreases the share of net wealth held by that group by 2.7%. In contrast, they increase their share by 2.18% in Ireland in response to an identical increase in house prices.

@boelhouwerHousingMarketNetherlands2020 present explanations for the dutch outlier results. The social housing sector in the Netherlands is larger than in other european countries, promising affordable renting for poorer households. Additionally, new stricter mortgage lending requirements were implemented in 2011, reducing the ability of first time buyers to afford buying a house. This could explain the very low share of housing wealth owned by the bottom 50% documented in @fig-distribution-indiv and the negative effect in response to increasing house prices.


![House Price Coefficient Plots](../output/ts_tables/HP_coeff.png){#fig-coeffplot}

In general, the individual regressions support the panel model results. Accelerating stock prices profits the upper decile of the wealth distribution, at the expense of the rest of the population. House prices have a contrary effect, increasing the share of the bottom 50% and middle 40%. Statistical significance as well as $R^2$ varies due to heterogeneity in the responses in european countries.

To address the outlier effect of the Netherlands, the panel regressions are re-estimated excluding this country. @tbl-panelNL compares the results of the preferred specification using the standard mean group estimator with and without the Dutch data.

Excluding the Netherlands slightly reduces the magnitude of the coefficients for house prices on the Top 10% and Middle 40%, but the signs and significance remain stable. For the Top 10%, the negative effect of house prices weakens from -0.057 to -0.069, while for the Middle 40%, the positive effect increases slightly and becomes more statistically significant.

The most notable change is for the bottom 50%. The coefficient on house prices increases from 0.253 to 0.395 and becomes statistically significant at the 1% level. This suggests that, once the outlier is removed, the effect of house prices on the lower half of the distribution becomes clearer and more robust.

Stock price effects remain broadly stable across all specifications, with a significant positive effect on the Top 10% and a negative effect on the Middle 40%, consistent with prior estimates. No meaningful change is observed when the Netherlands is excluded.

Overall, the results strengthen the interpretation that rising house prices tend to benefit the Bottom 50% and Middle 40%, while rising stock prices disproportionately benefit the Top 10%. Having established the sensitivity of wealth segments to asset prices, the next section simulates the evolution of wealth shares under different scenarios.

## Alternative Asset Price Scenarios {#sec-simulation}

To illustrate the distributional consequences of asset price dynamics, counterfactual scenarios are simulated using the estimated elasticities. Its goal is to highlight how wealth shares would have evolved if prices had followed a different path than observed. 

The values are estimated using the formula in @eq-fitted:
$$
\Delta \log (\hat{\omega}_{EU,t}^{T10}) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_h \, \Delta \log (p_{t}^h) + \hat{\beta}_s \, \Delta \log(p_t^s)
$$ {#eq-fitted}

and converted into counterfactual wealth shares using @eq-ctf:

$$
\hat{\omega}_{EU,t}^{T10}  = \hat{\omega}_{EU,t-1}^{T10} \cdot \exp \left( \Delta \log (\hat{\omega}_{EU,t}^{T10}) \right)
$$ {#eq-ctf}

Five scenarios are considered in the counterfactual simulations. (1) In the baseline scenario fitted values are calculated using the actual asset price paths observed in the Eurozone, with $\Delta p^h = \Delta p_{EU}^h$ and $\Delta p^s = \Delta p^s_{\text{Stoxx50}}$. (2) In the second scenario, stock prices are fixed to their initial value ($\Delta p^s = 0$), while house prices follow their observed path. (3) Conversely, the third scenario assumes stable house prices throughout ($\Delta p^h = 0$), with stock prices equal to the actual price index. (4) In the fourth case, house prices follow the trajectory observed in Greece ( $\Delta p^h = \Delta p^h_{GR}$ ). Finally, (5) house prices evolve as in Estonia ( $\Delta p^h = \Delta p^h_{EE}$ ), representing the strongest observed housing boom in the Eurozone. 

![Counterfactual Simulations of top decile wealth shares](../output/simulation/counterfactual_T10.png){#fig-ctfT10}


The fitted values in @fig-ctfT10 diverge slightly from actual values, particularly between 2013 and 2018, suggesting that there are factors not captured by the model. Over the full period from 2010 to 2022, the predicted as well as observed share of the top decile rises from 54.1% to 57.5%.

In a scenario with flat stock prices, the share increases, albeit at a slower rate. This indicates the important role equities play in wealth portfolios, as the top decile predominantly holds stocks. Conversely, in a scenario where house prices plateau, the middle 40% and the bottom 50% experience minimal wealth growth, resulting in a relative loss and greater wealth concentration at the top.

When house prices follow Estonia's trajectory, which exhibited the steepest growth in the Eurozone, the top decile's share is the lowest of all the scenarios. This suggests that rapid real estate appreciation can benefit the rest of the population trough relatively higher asset gains. In contrast, when prices follow Greece's trajectory of decline since 2010, the estimated share reaches its highest level. In this case, financial assets, mainly held by the top decile, drive wealth growth, thereby reinforcing concentration.

The results also enable the calculation of the approximate ratio of house price growth to stock price growth needed to maintain a stable top decile share[^e2]. The estimated ratio to fulfill this condition equals 4.07. This implies that house prices would need to grow more than four times as fast as stock prices to keep the top 10% wealth share constant. 

[^e2]: Starting from the regression equation $\Delta \log(\omega_{t}^{T10}) = \beta_h \Delta \log(p^h_t) + \beta_s \Delta \log({p^s_t}) + \epsilon_t$, the condition $\Delta \log(\omega_{t}^{T10}) = 0$ is imposed to keep the top 10% share constant. Solving for the ratio yields $\frac{\beta_h}{\beta_s}  = - \frac{\log({p^s})}{\log({p^h})}$. Substituting the estimated coefficients from @tbl-panelT10 results in the reported value.

This accounting exercise exemplifies the first order consequences of asset valuations in the wealth distribution. Rising house prices can, to a certain extent, compensate stock prices due to the differential distribution of gains among wealth segments. The estimated difference in top wealth shares between scenario (4) with low house price growth and (5) with high house price growth amounts to 6.8 percentage points. However, even the highest house price growth in Estonia does not reach the necessary ratio to keep the top decile wealth share stable.
